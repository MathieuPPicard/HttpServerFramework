# HttpServerFrame

My attempt at creating a http server from scratch, with a socket server on Java.

It will use my [HttpBuilder](https://github.com/MathieuPPicard/HttpBuilder) to help with the creation of http message and formating it.

Http Documentation that I use to follow the protocol.
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)
- [HttpWg](https://httpwg.org/specs/)

I will try to implement most of the specification but some details and usage case will maybe be ignored.
